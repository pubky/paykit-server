# Contributing to Paykit Server

Paykit Server is pre-production. Small, focused changes with explicit verification are preferred over broad refactors or compatibility layers for unreleased behavior.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- the Rust toolchain pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`
- PostgreSQL for database-backed E2E tests
- Docker with BuildKit only for the optional local Locks demo image

All Git dependencies are pinned and anonymously readable over HTTPS.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pubky/paykit-server.git
cd paykit-server
cargo check --locked
```

Copy `config/paykit-server.example.toml` to an operator-controlled path only when running the service. Never commit a populated local config, `.env` file, database URL, master key, account xpub, Pubky session material, or generated state.

## Tests and checks

Run the deterministic package checks before opening a pull request:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked -p paykit-server -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --locked -p paykit-server-e2e --no-run
git diff --check
```

The server suite is intentionally serialized because subprocess deadline tests can become load-sensitive under parallel execution.

Database-backed E2E tests create and drop isolated databases. `TEST_DATABASE_URL` must point to a PostgreSQL database whose role may create databases:

```bash
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres \
  cargo test --locked -p paykit-server-e2e -- --test-threads=1
```

Two live-adapter tests are ignored by default. They require external Pubky or Electrum infrastructure and are documented in `docs/live-adapter-smoke.md`. Do not claim those paths passed unless they were run explicitly against the documented environment.

## Pull requests

- Keep each pull request coherent and reviewable.
- Explain the behavior or contract being changed and why.
- Include reproduction and regression evidence for bug fixes where practical.
- State exactly which checks were run and which external checks were unavailable.
- Add tests for behavior changes.
- Update README, configuration examples, rustdoc, and active documentation when their contracts change.
- Avoid drive-by formatting, renames, dependency updates, and unrelated cleanup.
- Do not weaken validation or persistence invariants to accept drift from pre-production branches.

All CI checks must pass unless a reviewer explicitly accepts and records the risk. Authors should not self-merge; human reviewers remain accountable for changes produced with AI assistance.

## Security

Follow `SECURITY.md`. Never include vulnerability details or sensitive operational material in a public issue or pull request.
