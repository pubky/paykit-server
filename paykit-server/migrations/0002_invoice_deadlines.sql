-- One-time destructive reset for the undeployed prototype schema.
--
-- Historical invoice rows cannot be backfilled with authoritative payment
-- deadlines or later lock-resource attribution. SQLx records this migration
-- transactionally, so the reset runs once when upgrading from migration 0001
-- and is not repeated on later application starts.
