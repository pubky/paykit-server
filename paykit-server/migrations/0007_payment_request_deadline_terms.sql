-- Staging-only hard cutover to rc56 immutable Payment Request terms.
--
-- Existing invoice, SDK, outbox, lifecycle, and drain rows encode rc48/rc55
-- semantics and cannot be reinterpreted safely. Paykit Server has not reached
-- production, so reset all dependent staging state before installing the new
-- closed deadline schema. SQLx records this migration transactionally.
