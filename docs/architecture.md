# Shared Paykit integration

Paykit Server runs as one process with multiple isolated Creator accounts. It owns
Locks invoice workflows and direct Bitcoin/USDT observation, but delegates Paykit protocol
state, Encrypted Links, App Registry updates, and private message delivery to the
published Paykit SDK. Domain terminology follows the dependency's `THESAURUS.md`.

## Authority and setup

Bitkit grants Pubky access to `/pub/paykit/:rw` and delegates a generation-bound
Paykit Identity Secret. Initial setup also requests a BIP84 account xpub; reconnect
preserves the Bitcoin account for an existing Creator. When USDT is enabled, setup and reconnect also request an optional Arbitrum receiving address. The server never receives
Bitcoin spending keys or the Pubky identity secret. Receiving details cannot change through reauthorization; a previously omitted USDT address may be added.

The companion claim is bound to the AUTH identity, secret, and exact permission
list. Before delegation or private app publication, the identity owner uses
`PAYKIT_AUTHORIZER_SESSION_CAPABILITIES` and
`publish_paykit_noise_key_authorization()` to publish its signed current Noise key.
Only that owner session can write `/pub/paykit-authority/v0/current-key.json`;
Server's ordinary Paykit grant must not include that path.
Setup verifies the delegated key and generation against the identity-signed
Paykit Noise Key Authorization before
persisting credentials. Under the Creator setup lock, it persists credentials,
publishes the `paykit-server` app through SDK locks, reads that app back, and marks
setup complete. Publication failure leaves retryable credentials and never
rewrites another app's registry entry. See [the wire contract](bitkit-companion-claim.md).

Session readiness also verifies the signed authorization. Missing, tampered, or
mismatched records fail validation; the App Registry supplies discovery metadata
and app capabilities, not key authority.

Setup, status queries, and workers use one process-owned session cache. Independently
restoring a live grant can invalidate its bearer. A changed persisted session or
delegated key causes the cached provider to refresh its access; unchanged credentials
reuse the live handle.

## State ownership

PostgreSQL owns encrypted Creator credentials, address allocation, reader
assignments, invoices, payment observations, and fenced delivery intents. AEAD
binds private payloads to their type, Creator, and row; keyed lookup hashes support
queries without plaintext identities or payment details.

The SDK owns encrypted identity-wide homeserver state under WebDAV locks. Apps
share Encrypted Links and history; app IDs attribute requests and outbound records.
The server does not maintain a PostgreSQL copy of SDK state. Its transport worker
receives private events and processes queued delivery without executing payments.
The local reader demo likewise uses hosted SDK state; its encrypted local file
retains only the app/Creator binding and a process ownership lock.

Deployed Pubky Homeserver instances must run 0.15 or newer. Shared-state safety
requires commit-time fencing of expired lock holders and durable publication of
complete files; the SDK's five-minute uncertain-write cooldown remains in place
and is not a substitute for those storage guarantees.

## Invoice and settlement invariants

A database transaction allocates one fresh BIP84 address per invoice and persists
the complete Payment Request with that address in `payment_endpoints` and
`required_app_id = "paykit-server"`. Exact replay returns the same invoice,
assignment, terms, and outbox row. A different Bitcoin invoice cannot reuse its address. USDT invoices share the approved address and attribute individual transfers through verified request proofs.
Reader discovery checks that at least one registered app supports private payments,
Payment Requests, and outgoing payments; it does not select a receiver path.

SDK handoff is at least once. Reconciliation identifies the exact outbound ID and
app; only SDK `Sent` means delivered, not payer acknowledgement. See
[outbox recovery](outbox-recovery.md) for leases and retry behavior.

Bitcoin attribution uses direct observation of the invoice-specific address. USDT attribution combines an authenticated, request-bound ERC-20 account signature with independent Arbitrum receipt verification. Neither SDK lifecycle state nor a transaction hash alone proves settlement. One amount-matched output is required; split outputs are not aggregated.
A Bitcoin amount-matched output freezes at one confirmation and becomes final at six. USDT observations remain reorg-sensitive until the RPC finalized block covers the receipt; their unique transfer identity cannot settle another invoice.
No spending, refunds, receipt issuance, or horizontal replicas are supported.
